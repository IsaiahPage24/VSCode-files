            Preparing for your white water rafting adventure with Dry Oar is easy! 
            We recommend bringing comfortable swimwear, secure footwear (such as water shoes or sandals with straps), 
            and a hat for sun protection. Don't forget to apply waterproof sunscreen before hitting the rapids. 
            It's also a good idea to bring a change of clothes for after the trip, as you might get wet during the excitement. 
            We provide all necessary rafting equipment, including life jackets and helmets, so no need to worry about that. 
            If you have any specific questions about what to bring for a particular trip, 
            feel free to check the trip details or give our team a call. 
            Get ready to have a fantastic time on the river with Dry Oar!

            <p>When I was young I had a lot of self hatred. I did not like myself at all, and felt extremely guilty all the time.</p>
            <p>After I got to college, I still carried a lot of that with me. My wife tried to help, but she didn't know much about depression or low self-esteem.</p>
            <p>After letting go of a lot of past traumas (and a lovely mushroom trip teehee), I am actually happy and I love myself. Yay!</p>

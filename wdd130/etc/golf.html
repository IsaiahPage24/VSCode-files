            <p>My Grandfather golfed his entire life. It wasn't until he passed that I finally picked up the sport.</p>
            <p>The year after his death, I went to live with my Grandma. I worked that summer at a golf course, which gave me the tools to learn the game.</p>
            <p>After two years, I am still absolutely abysmal!</p>
